# riingo development version

* A small change was made in `riingo_iex_quote()` to reflect the fact that the 
Tiingo API correctly returns JSON arrays now. 

* The deprecated `glue::collapse()` has been replaced 
with `glue::glue_collapse()` (#7).

# riingo 0.1.0

* First release
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
